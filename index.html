		<i><h1 align="center">Climate Change</h1></i>
		
		<p><b>Climate change</b> is one of the burning issues the world is facing currently. It is an issue that isn’t targeted to any specific group of people rather it will affect the whole of mankind. But it will affect people living below the poverty line the most. <b><u><bdo dir="rtl">Global warming</bdo></u></b> is considered one of the main reasons for climate change. Global warming indicates the rise in <b><u><bdo dir="rtl">temperature</bdo></u></b> worldwide which is caused by different reasons. As the developed countries are producing tons of <b><u><bdo dir="rtl">greenhouse</bdo></u></b> gases regularly, it is damaging the nature very fast. But the <b><u><bdo dir="rtl">developing or underdeveloped</bdo></u></b> countries have to face the result of climate change first. As a result of global warming, different natural <b><u><bdo dir="rtl">calamities</bdo></u></b> like floods, cyclones, drought will occur and they will take thousands of lives. As poor people worldwide have no safety measure against all these, they will suffer the most. Moreover, polar ice packs will also melt with the rise of temperature which is very risky for the people living in coastal areas. It has been found in researches that if the average temperature rises by 2 degrees Celsius, sea level will rise by 1 meter. It will cause thousands of people living in coastal areas to leave their <b><u><bdo dir="rtl">accommodation</bdo></u></b>. As Bangladesh is surrounded by the Bay of Bengal in the southern part of the country, Bangladesh is also at risk of being affected by climate change. With the <b><u><bdo dir="rtl">industrial</bdo></u></b> revolution, millions of <b><u><bdo dir="rtl">factories</bdo></u></b> are set up and they are emitting chemicals that are very harmful to nature. If they don’t take proper steps to prevent this, it will take a short time to damage the atmosphere of this planet. Even using <b><u><bdo dir="rtl">excessive</bdo></u></b> motor vehicles leads to carbon emission which damages nature greatly. Though the world leaders are <b><u><bdo dir="rtl">discussing</bdo></u></b> to reduce the carbon emission globally, we should be aware of the upcoming danger. Our <b><u><bdo dir="rtl">government</bdo></u></b> should take proper steps to save the greenery and tree plantation can play a vital role to fight climate change. Also, the factories should be compliant with the safety rules so that no harmful <b><u><bdo dir="rtl">chemicals</bdo></u></b> can enter nature without being treated. This way, we would be able to build a world for our next <b><u><bdo dir="rtl">generation</bdo></u></b> which will be healthier and safer. It is our duty to save our planet from the adverse effects of climate change and it is high time we should <b><u><bdo dir="rtl">take steps</bdo></u></b>.</p>

		<p><font size="6" color="green" face="sans-serif">Climate change is the most serious issue at the moment over the world. The cause of climate change can be divided into two categories those are due to natural causes,and those are created by the man. Global warming is the main natural reason and using harmful chemicals in everyday life is the main reason created by man.The climate is changing rapidly that effect in the rise of the earth’s average temperature. The global climate change and its outcomes are leaving a bad impact on the developing countries. Like Bangladesh, forcing the poor countries to face natural disasters and poverty. Climate change impacts include temperature rise, greenhouse and carbon dioxide gas emissions,irregular rainfall, the rise of floods, cyclones, storm surges and draught, ice sheets melting which will seriously Affect agriculture and livelihoods.</font></p>
		
		<p><font size="5" color="red" face="sans-serif">Bangladesh, for Its geographical Locations, is likely to be the most affected.The Developed nations, which are more responsible for such climate changes,should take responsibilities to Protect the victimized countries. The Maldives is also one of the worst victims of climate change. A one-meter sea-level rise will submerge about one-third of the total area of Bangladesh, which will uproot 25-30 million people of Bangladesh. These people will become refugees of climate change.
		To reduce the bad impact of climate change people should be aware. Tree plantation can reduce global warming which is the main natural reason for Climate Change. Stop using harmful chemicals can reduce environmental pollution which is the main man-made reason for climate change. Students should be careful to protect the environment and raise awareness. Thus students can play a vital role to reduce the bad impact of climate change.</font></p>
		
		<p><font size="4" color="blue" face="sans-serif">The global climate change has many bad impacts. Climate change causes a temperature rise, greenhouse and carbon dioxide gas emissions, erratic rainfall, salinity intrusion, the rise of floods, cyclones, drought, ice sheets melting which will seriously affect agriculture and livelihood, especially at the poor. Bangladesh is likely to be the most affected because of its geographical location. One-third of the total land of Bangladesh will go underwater if the sea level rises one meter. The developed nations, which are more responsible for such climate changes, should take responsibility to protect the victim countries. Now we can not stop changing the climate. We should be aware to reduce the bad impact of climate change. Tree plantation can reduce global warming which is the main reason for climate change. We should stop using harmful chemicals can reduce environmental pollution.</font></p>
